🤝 Acknowledgements

This portfolio is built using the Simplefolio template originally created by Jacobo Martinez. The design and structure have been customized and extended to reflect my personal projects, skills, and development journey.

📜 License

This project is licensed under the MIT License.

⭐ If you like this project, consider giving it a star!

If you want, next I can help you write a short 2–3 line bio for the top hero section of your actual portfolio site (the line recruiters read first).

Niceee you’re deploying on Vercel now — love that move 🚀
The red error is super small, easy fix.

🔴 Problem

Your project name is:

my-Portfolio


Vercel only allows lowercase letters.

✅ Fix

Change the project name to something like:

my-portfolio


or

sudhanshu-portfolio


or

portfolio


All lowercase. No spaces. Hyphens are fine.

⚙️ Important Settings for Simplefolio (Parcel)

Before clicking Deploy, expand Build and Output Settings and make sure:

Build Command
npm run build

Output Directory
dist


Parcel builds the production site into the dist folder — Vercel needs to know that.

📁 Root Directory

Leave it as:

./


That’s correct since your package.json is in the root.
